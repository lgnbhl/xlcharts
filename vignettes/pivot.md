# Pivot Tables

openpyxl provides read-support for pivot tables so that they will be preserved in existing files. The specification for pivot tables, while extensive, is not very clear and it is not intended that client code should be able to create pivot tables. However, it should be possible to edit and manipulate existing pivot tables, eg. change their ranges or whether they should update automatically settings.
